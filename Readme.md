# FAMER's AMIGO

<b>Aim:</b> The project intends to help farmers in the selection of optimal crops based on their farmland soil composition and in choosing the crop that can maximize their profits.

This project has two major components -

- <b>Crop Recommendation System:</b>  This model is built by using a Decision tree. The model will predict the crop based on the soil composition aspects like Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, Rainfall, Humidity, and temperature of the agricultural land with an accuracy of 98%. Crop-wise analysis of the data has been done and created a dashboard in Google Data Studios you can access it [here](https://datastudio.google.com/s/msTpfsa52TY).

- <b>Forecasting the price of the crop:</b> This model will forecast the price of the crops recommended by the above model. The forecast period is the same as the selected crops growing period. So that farmer can choose the crop which will maximize his profits. The model is being built using the Facebook Prophet Forcasting Algoritham .
